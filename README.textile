net.cgrand.regex is a Clojure notation (DSL) for regexes.

Regexes are already a DSL of their own but a write-only DSL. 

This DSL allows to reuse regexes or parts of them and also adds support for named groups.

This project started as a toy/lab for the DSL course at "Conj Labs Brussels":http://conj-labs.eu back in June 2010.
